Movuploader is an OSX app for uploading pictures of your moustache to movember.com.

It will take a picture of you using your iSight camera, and then upload to your Movember page. 
You will need an account on movember.com to use this app. 

To build the app, File -> Save As..., save as an Application, read-only. 
Then, run the following command:

mv upload /Applications/Movuploader.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/
note: you need to comment out the line "tell application "Movuploader" to activate" when working in script builder - apparently it doesn't know that it exists.
